# Cobol Samples 

Short sample programs that illustrate how to carry out various programming tasks in Cobol. 

## How to run the sample programs 

On z/OS, compile-link-go. HEX2TEXT is a subprogram. The other samples are main programs.

On Linux, Unix, Windows, or OS X, install a Cobol compiler that offers source-level compatibility with IBM Enterprise Cobol. Compile HEX2TEXT as a subprogram (.so or .dll), and the other sample programs as main programs. 

## Using basic Cobol statements

### How can I...

- [MOVEME](MOVEME-notes.md) ...assign values to Data Division items?

## Working with datasets

#### How can I... 

- [CPSEQFR](CPSEQFR-notes.md) ...read and write sequential (QSAM) files with fixed-length records?
- [CPSEQVR](CPSEQVR-notes.md) ...read and write sequential (QSAM) files with variable-length records ?

## Working with text data

#### How can I... 

- [STRINGIT](STRINGIT-notes.md) ...use INSPECT, STRING, and reference modification to manipulate text data?
- [HELLO](HELLO-notes.md) ...eliminate trailing spaces in variable-length text data?
- [REFORMER](REFORMER-notes.md) ...use various Cobol statements to reformat records?

## Working with numeric data

## Working with dates and times 

#### How can I...

- [DATE1](DATE1-notes.md) ...get the current date and time using the CURRENT-DATE intrinsic function?
